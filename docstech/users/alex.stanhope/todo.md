### Send envelopes between machines through a sync service [](?id=coordinator-sync-client)

Story [[coordinator-views]] reaches agents on the same machine only. An agent on another machine is out of reach unless the operator opens a second window there. This story adds delivery between machines, through a sync service chosen in a setting.

+ background
  + the sync client and the per-instance process belong to thinkersync, a separate open-source project; this story only uses them
  + dependency: delivery between machines cannot be built until thinkersync's client library exists, so this story waits on it
  + measured 2026-11-12: thinkersync's client library is written but not released as a package, its per-instance process is still being built, and its sync service is not yet deployed
  + an instance is one NoteThink instance: a VS Code window on a folder, or the browser workbench
  + each instance runs its own thinkersync client and process, and stays independent of other instances on the same machine
+ approach
  + a VS Code setting names the sync service, defaulting to notethink.com
  + the extension starts and stops one client process per instance, and the views from [[coordinator-views]] list agents from other machines the same way as local ones
  + an envelope for an agent on another machine goes through the chosen service; one for a local agent still goes straight to its mailbox
  + the view shows whether the chosen service reports that it holds nothing for this instance
  + a service that is unreachable leaves local sending working and says so beside the remote agents
+ [ ] add the sync service setting with notethink.com as its default, and document it in `README.md`
+ [ ] start and stop one thinkersync client process per instance
+ [ ] route envelopes for agents on other machines through the chosen service
+ [ ] show remote agents beside local ones, marked by machine
+ [ ] show whether the service holds nothing for this instance
+ [ ] state the network use in the Agent activity section of `README.md`, which today says NoteThink reads no network endpoint for agent activity
+ [ ] cover the setting, the process lifecycle and the routing choice with Jest tests
+ [ ] bump the patch version
+ decision 2026-11-13: hold this story until thinkersync releases its client library and per-instance process; no build against a fake of their contract
